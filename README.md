# HODO

A terminal-based (TUI) todo list application written in Haskell, built with the Brick library.

## Usage

There are three modes in hodo: `Normal`, `Change`, `Add`

Most time you will in the `Normal` mode, press `up` `down` `left` `right` to select item in your todo list.

Press 'c' into the `Change` mode, which allows you to move the item you have been selected.

Press 'r' in the `Noraml` mode will delete the current item you have been selected.

Press 'a' to add a new item in the pending list.

You can directly change the file `todo.txt` to change the items' states.
